Junior Data Analyst with over 30 years of experience in commercial and administrative roles, now applying that business foundation to data-driven decision making.
In my previous role, I led the analysis of over 1,500 student satisfaction surveys, reviewing 37,500 data points across multiple themes and subtopics. I was responsible for cleaning the data, identifying inconsistencies and null values, segmenting responses by class type, and extracting insights that highlighted key strengths and areas for improvement. 
Using bar charts, pie charts, and trend lines, I presented clear visual summaries to both internal stakeholders and corporate clients. These data-informed recommendations led to service enhancements that strengthened client relationships â€” resulting in contracts being renewed for up to 10 years.
